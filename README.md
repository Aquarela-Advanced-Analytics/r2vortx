# r2vortx
This package is an easy way to integrate (automate) R programs using the Aquarela VORTX plataform. In other words, R programs can use r2vortx functions to send and receive jobs to/from VORTX.

Also, it has some functions that integrates R to OpenRefine as well. OpenRefine is an open source tool for data cleansing, and can be downloaded at http://openrefine.org/.

 - The main functions are:
   - **vortx_organizer**: Creates a job in VORTX **AND** runs Organizer, which peforms a pure automated clustering and outlier detection process while extracting the measurements of systemic importance of each factor/variable.
   - **vortx_discoverer**: Creates a job in VORTX **AND** runs Discoverer which is used for Business Scenario Discovery, which automatically shows the systemic combination of factors/variables related to a certain goal, key drivers and wheights of each variable.
   - **vortx_dataset**: Gets dataset of a processed job in VORTX.
   - **vortx_info**: Gets all available information from a processed job in VORTX.

Every function requires an API Key from VORTX, 
so it is recommended to add it as a variable in your programming environment.
 
 - Functions for OpenRefine:
   - **refine_push**: Sends data from R to local OpenRefine
   - **refine_pull**: Gets data from local OpenRefine to R
   - **refine_list**: Lists projects in local OpenRefine
   - **refine_kill**: Deletes project in local OpenRefine

Arguments and usage can be found in the documentation.
